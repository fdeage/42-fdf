# 42-fdf

## Overview

`fdf` (from French "Fil de fer", for "iron wire") is a project displaying an isometric representation of a 3D-array - with colors! It uses the minilibX, a basic graphical library in C in wide use at 42 and EPITECH.

It needs the `libft` library to work. This repo doesn't include the `libft` source files, but includes an already-compiled `libft.a`. The `libft` sources can be found [here](https://github.com/fdeage/42-libft).


`fdf` is a first-year project from the [42](#42) school, which I attended in 2013-2016. It abides to the strict rules of 42 not to exceed 5 functions per file, or 25 lines per function.


## Getting started

To compile the project:
```
?> ./make
```

Then you can launch it with a file representing a map:
```
?> ./fdf <file>
```


## 42

[42](https://www.42.fr) is a French programming school founded in 2013, rooted in P2P collaboration and self-directed learning. Its pedagogy is fully project-based. It is considered a [good place](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/847844863727087616) to learn to code.
